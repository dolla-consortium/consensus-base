-- | Event-based file and folder watching for OS X
module System.OSX.FSEvents
data EventStream

-- | Create an FSEvents watch for a list of paths. The callback action will
--   be called for each event in the watched paths until the
--   <a>EventStream</a> is destroyed again. All callbacks are from a single
--   thread, so if you take too long to process an event, further events
--   will be delayed. Note: it's relatively expensive to create a watch,
--   since each watch uses an operating system thread for its event loop.
eventStreamCreate :: [FilePath] -> Double -> Bool -> Bool -> Bool -> (Event -> IO a) -> IO EventStream

-- | Destroy an event stream, the callback action will not be run for new
--   events (but there may be pending events remaining)
